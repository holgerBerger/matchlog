MATCHLOG
========

a simple log file viewer, which displays all files specified on command line
sorted by time in one buffer, using different colors for lines with errors,
warning or success messages.
Different source hosts have different colors.
So far two date formats can be parsed, as they are used on ubuntu and redhat 6.
Further formats might needed to be added.
With --hosts one can specify a comma separated list of hosts files,
which is used to resolve IPv4 address in the logfiles to hostname.

TODO
----

* hotkey to show/hide lines from certain files/hosts
* hotkey to mark lines for a second buffer which can be displayed as alternative
  to main buffer
* hotkey to add regular expressions for line coloring
* config file to add regular expressions for line coloring
