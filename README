MATCHLOG
========

a simple log file viewer, which displays all files specified on command line
sorted by time in one buffer, using different colors for lines with errors,
warning or success messages.
Different source hosts have different colors.
So far two date formats can be parsed, as they are used on ubuntu and redhat 6.
Further formats might needed to be added.

TODO
----

* IP address resolution with a provided hosts file
* hotkey to show/hide lines from certain files/hosts
* hotkey for search
* hotkey to mark lines for a second buffer which can be displayed as alternative
  to main buffer
* hotkey to add regular expressions for line coloring
* config file to add regular expressions for line coloring
